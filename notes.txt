- Z position not calculated within cell for entities 
- local_x/y not implemented correcty. Depends on point of view.
- moving through entities could look better
- floor and ceiling textures not implemented at all, but I doubt they will be necessary for a while
- minimap doesn't account for map edges
- shader solution for limiting graphics to the viewport doesn't quite work when window is wide/short
