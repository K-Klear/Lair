Bugs:
- local_x/y not implemented correcty. Depends on point of view.
- Moving through entities could look better
- Minimap doesn't account for map edges

Missing features:
- Z position not calculated within cell for entities
- Floor and ceiling textures

Things to improve:
- I should reduce entity_get_position arguments
- Use wall_stats to get wall info, only store the key
